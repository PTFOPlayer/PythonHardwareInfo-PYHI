
**program to display the stats of a pc using the pyqt5 library**
author: WhiskyAKM (Patryk T)

app works with the following os:
windows 10 - partial support (only cpu cores and usage, ram, drives, network, nvidia gpu)
linux - full support (cpu cores, usage, ram, drives, network, nvidia gpu)
currently only works with nvidia gpu but can be extended to other gpu's

radeon gpu's will be supported in the future by using the rocm-smi 
usage of rocm may cause reduction of stats refresh rate and will cause large ram usage

supported gpu's:

nvidia gpu's: 
full support for all gpus newer than tesla 2.0 
tested on series: maxwell, pascal, turing 
radeon gpu's:
support for all gpus from HD7000 series
tested on series: HD7000, RX400

Needed modules:
pyqt5 (old TK version in /old)
psutil
cpuinfo
